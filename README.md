# BTM-LLM-Prompt-Engineering

--Explination--
The idea of this project is to see how well different LLM's can analyse test cases
We want to find the best prompts, that produce the best results. 
The basic structure is below, you are encouraged to change the prompts as you see fit. log the results and streamline the prompts. 
--Explination--

1. Run Project Initialization Prompt.
2. Add one test case at a time
3. Run generateDetailedDescription.txt
4. Run explainTestProperties.txt
5. Run requirements.txt
6. Run traceability.txt
7. Run coverageReport.txt
8. Run gapAnalysis.txt

--Additionally--
Add the results from each stage of prompting to the (step).txt file in the appropriate folder (given your LLM).
