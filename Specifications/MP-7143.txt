JIRA Epic MP-8832 – General 7.0.0.

JIRA Story MP-7143 - Calls notification to managers will only include managers that have a status of 'Current’.

Description

As the Admin User in Mojo I do not want Tenant calls to be passed to managers that are no longer part of the organisation. I therefore want to exclude non-current managers from receiving notifications when their manager type is in the notify column of the Call Subject grid.

Required

Any manager that does not have a status of ‘Current’ will be excluded for notifications where their manager type has been identified as receiving notifications for a specific call subject.

Where there are no current managers of that type then the logic of the Call subjects routine will apply and the emails will be sent to the Individual/Backup Email(s)



The above is the original diagram form ‘MP-5064: Facility to manage Tenant to Home Company Communications‘

We have added in the additional restriction for checking the current / Non-current managers (underlined in red above).


Acceptance Criteria

Given - A call to be raised with a subject that has a manager type to notify,

And - There are managers attached to that Manager type, with a status of both ‘Current’ and ‘Archived’

When - the call is actually raised

Then - emails are sent to managers that are Current and are that manager type for that property

And - Emails are not sent to managers that are not Current.

Given - A call to be raised with a subject that has a manager type to notify,

And - There are no ‘Current’ managers attached to that Manager type

When - the call is actually raised

Then -  Emails are not sent to managers that manager type for that property

And - the email is sent to the ‘Individual/backup’ Emails

NB - the above requirements should include where there is only one current manager and where there is multiple current managers of the relevant manager type
