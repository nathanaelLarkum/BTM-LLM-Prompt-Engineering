SIT:Christopher Young Lead - Dev:Paul Aylett  Description   As a Mojo user I wish to control whether Commitments are included in my Service charge reviews when using the Budget v Actual widget.There will be a default choice setting in the Widget properties (Admin Dashboard>Mojo>Manage widget)There will be a Choice setting on the face of the widget (within the Filter icon) that will allow the individual user to override the default setting thus switching between including and excluding Commitments. Required* Default in Admin Dashboard>Widget propertiesA new choice will be included - “Include Commitments in calculations”There will be a Yes/No dropdown choice which will be the default for this widget Where: Yes is chosen. The widget will behave as currently where Variance calculations include any commitments and the column choices for ‘Commitments’ and 'Actual plus Commitments' will be available where there are commitment for that period.No is chosen. The widget will ignore any commitments in calculations and the column choices for ‘Commitments' and 'Actual plus Commitments’ will not be available in any situation The above setting is a default and so can be overwritten on the Dashboard widget itself.When upgrading to this version, the option will be set to ‘Yes’ on install.* Dashboard widgetA new choice “Include Commitments in calculations” will be add on the same row as the Widget Title.This new section will move to ensure no overlapping will occur with the title on the left or the Icons on the right.The Dropdown options will only allow one to be chosen at a time and will be * Default ( Yes ) o where the bracketed text will be * 'Yes' if the default setting is yes* ‘No’ if the default setting is No* Yes o Default will be ignored. The widget will behave as currently where Variance calculations include any commitments and the column choices for ‘Commitments’ and 'Actual plus Commitments' will be available where there are commitment for that period* No o Default will be ignored. The widget will ignore any commitments in calculations and the column choices for ‘Commitments' and 'Actual plus Commitments’ will not be available in any situation Comments   Comment by Jeremy Jee [ 01/May/24 ] IMHO the Edit Filters dialog should use a dropdown to be consistent with the Default / Yes / No selection in User Preferences -Comment by Tony Murrell [ 07/Feb/25 ] Flag added I’ve spent far too much time trying to get this to work. The code is there, it just needs some adjustments.
