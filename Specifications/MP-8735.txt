JIRA Story Ref MP-8735 Options to download visible columns only from lister pages or all columns that you are allowed to access

Description

Currently, if you download a lister page, you get the columns you have selected plus all columns for the given table (whether they are displayed on the screen or not and whether you are allowed to see them or not) . 

As a mojo user, when i click to download a lister table to excel, i would like to have two options. 1). to download just the displayed columns and 2). to download all columns that i am allowed to see. 

This is so that

a) I don’t see information I’m not allowed to see

b) I can easily get a download of just the columns i myself have chosen. 

 

To achieve this: 

When a user left clicks on a download button (within the lister pages) then just the visible columns will be downloaded to the CSV file, in the order in which they have been arranged on-screen. 

When a user right clicks clicks on a download button (within the lister pages), a pop up menu will give them 2 options: (download) visible columns or (download) all columns. 

Suggested Format: 



When the download visible columns option is selected then the same download will happen as per the left click option. 

When the ‘All columns’ option is selected, this refers to all columns that are available to view for this lister (as defined in the System Settings).

Currently 

you get the columns you have selected plus all columns for the given table (whether they are displayed on the screen or not and whether you are allowed to see them or not)
