    <h1>Test Case Gap Analysis for MP-9988</h1>
    
    <div class="summary-container">
        <h3>Gap Analysis Summary</h3>
        <p>This analysis identifies potential gaps in test coverage for the MP-9988 requirements, with a focus on high-priority scenarios that may not be adequately tested by the existing test cases.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="priority-high">High Priority Gaps:</span> 3 potential gaps identified</li>
            <li><span class="priority-medium">Medium Priority Gaps:</span> 2 potential gaps identified</li>
            <li><span class="priority-low">Low Priority Gaps:</span> 1 potential gap identified</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>High Priority Test Case Gaps</h2>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-high">Gap 1:</span> Security Validation for User Access</h3>
        <div class="source-text">
            "Test user with appropriate security group access"
        </div>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While REQ-007 states that users must have appropriate security group access, there is no test case that explicitly verifies this security requirement. This is a high-priority gap because it involves a security control that could lead to unauthorized access if not properly implemented.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Create a test case that verifies users without appropriate security group access cannot perform form creation or access operations. This test should attempt to access the functionality with both valid and invalid security credentials and verify the system correctly enforces access controls.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-high">Gap 2:</span> Validation of Required Invoice Fields</h3>
        <div class="source-text">
            "Enter invoice details using test data"
        </div>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While TC-004 "Handling of missing invoice data" is listed in the test case table, it's marked as "Not Covered." This is a high-priority gap because data validation is critical for ensuring system integrity and preventing data corruption. Failure to validate required fields could lead to incomplete or invalid forms being created.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Implement TC-004 to verify the system properly validates all required fields during invoice submission. The test should attempt to submit forms with missing required fields and verify appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-high">Gap 3:</span> Supplier Account Authentication</h3>
        <div class="source-text">
            "Valid supplier account with MFS access"
        </div>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While TC-010 "Supplier account validation before form creation" is identified in the test case table, it's marked as "Not Covered." This is a high-priority gap because it relates to authentication and authorization, which are critical security controls. Improper implementation could allow unauthorized access to the system.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Implement TC-010 to verify that the system properly validates supplier accounts before allowing access to invoice submission functionality. The test should verify that suppliers without valid accounts or proper MFS access cannot submit invoices.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Medium Priority Test Case Gaps</h2>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-medium">Gap 4:</span> Duplicate Invoice Prevention</h3>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> TC-009 "Handling duplicate invoice submission" is listed in the test case table but marked as "Not Covered." This is a medium-priority gap because while not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, it's an important data integrity check to prevent duplicate payments and ensure financial accuracy.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Implement TC-009 to verify the system can detect and prevent duplicate invoice submissions. The test should attempt to submit the same invoice twice and verify the system provides appropriate warning messages and prevents the duplicate submission.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-medium">Gap 5:</span> Form Creation Performance</h3>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> TC-008 "Form creation response time" is listed in the test case table but marked as "Not Covered." While not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, performance is an important aspect of system quality, particularly for user experience.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Implement TC-008 to verify the form creation process meets performance expectations. The test should measure the response time for form creation under different conditions (normal load, peak load) and verify it remains within acceptable parameters.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Low Priority Test Case Gaps</h2>
    
    <div class="gap-container">
        <h3><span class="priority-low">Gap 6:</span> Administrator Notification</h3>
        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> TC-007 "Administrator notification of new form" is listed in the test case table but marked as "Not Covered." While not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, notifications can be important for workflow efficiency.</p>
        <div class="recommendation">
            <p><strong>Recommended Test Case:</strong> Implement TC-007 to verify if administrators receive appropriate notifications when new forms are created. This would enhance the test coverage by ensuring administrators are properly informed of new submissions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
